#Weathers
Today we're going to make an app that utilizes the Weather Underground and HTML5 Geolocaiton APIs This project is going to be fairly hands-off. Rather than take you through steps-by-step we're going to give you a list of resources and requirements. Use the resources to create an application that meets the requirements.

Some companies, in lieu of a traditional technical interview, will give you something like this. It gives you the chance to show off UI skills as well as your ability to create an application that can consume data! Have fun with it! 

##Requirements:
  Create a web application that does the following:
  - Gets the current forcast for the users current geolocation.
  - Gets the current forcast for a City and State entered in by the user.
  - Gets the weather for a date in history entered in by the user.
  - Use AngularJS

##Resources:
